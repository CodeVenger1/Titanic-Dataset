# Titanic Dataset Analysis & Logistic Regression

This repository contains an analysis of the Titanic dataset and a logistic regression model to predict passenger survival.

## Files in This Repository

- **`titanic.csv`** - The dataset containing passenger details.
- **`Titanic dataset analysis.ipynb`** - Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset.
- **`Logistic-Regression_titanic_data.ipynb`** - Logistic regression model implementation to predict survival.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze the Titanic dataset and build a predictive model using logistic regression. The analysis includes:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and engineering
- Building and evaluating a logistic regression model

## Installation & Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-analysis.git
   cd titanic-analysis
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
3. Run Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open and execute the notebooks.

## Results & Insights
- Key factors affecting survival.
- Performance of the logistic regression model.
- Visualizations and statistical summaries of passenger data.

## Contributing
