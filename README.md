#Titanic Dataset Analysis

##Overview

This repository contains an analysis of the Titanic dataset, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning model implementation using logistic regression to predict passenger survival.

##Files in the Repository

titanic.csv: The dataset containing information about Titanic passengers.

Titanic dataset analysis.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook that performs data exploration, visualization, and feature engineering.

Logistic-Regression_titanic_data.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook implementing a logistic regression model to predict survival.

Requirements

To run the notebooks, install the required Python libraries:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

Usage

Clone the repository:

git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>

Open Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

Run the notebooks step by step to explore the data and train the model.

Key Insights

Data visualization highlights trends in survival rates based on gender, class, and age.

Logistic regression is used to classify passengers as survived or not based on various features.

Future Improvements

Implement other machine learning models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest).

Feature engineering to improve model accuracy.

Deploy the model as a web application.
